# A Weakly-Supervised Machine Learning Method for fine-grained semantic indexing of biomedical literature

## About this repository

This repository includes the final (third) part of [my thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10889/27628) on the fine-grained semantic indexing of biomedical literature.

The first and second parts involve the development of a large-scale dataset and its enhancement with weak supervision and are part of a [paper in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics _(JBI)_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104499). The implementation of the previous parts is available [here](https://github.com/ThomasChatzopoulos/MeSH_retrospective_dataset).

In the last part of the paper, [Anastasios Nentidis](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/people/anastasios-nentidis/) uses a [Deep Learning approach](https://github.com/tasosnent/DBM), while in my thesis I focus on a Machine Learning method, an XGBoost model _(as well as a logistic regression model as a baseline)_.
